         * Given three String variables of some text find and print the longest word that also contains 'a'

         *     Ex:
         *         "java"
         *         "mouse"
         *         "computer"
         *         Output: java
         *     Ex:
         *         "java"
         *         "mouse"

         * Challenge: Instead of just checking for 'a' add another variable that can be used to check for any character.
